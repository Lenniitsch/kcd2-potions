## ℹ️ About

This is just a small personal hobby project I made for myself and a friend to use during our playthroughs. I wasn't happy with the potion guides I found online, so I curated my own "database" with all potions. The goal was to make the lookup process as easy as possible.

I usually have it open while brewing potions in-game.

**No claim to be complete or perfect – just good enough for my needs.** 😊
